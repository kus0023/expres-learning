Cookie is file which send from browser with every req.
And server also send the cookie with each res.

In cookies we can send user Id info and then server can validate based on the user ID if a user is valid or not.

Hit a req with cookie --> Server  ---> checks in DB --> response back to browser/client with cookies ----> user receives it if he is valid.
